# Openconfig Telemetry Demo using Telegraf Plugin

This project show how to collect Openconfig Telemetry information on a Juniper devices
using an open source software name `telegraf`.

To be able to collect Openconfig Telemetry with Telegraf, Juniper developed a new input plugin name `openconfig_telemetry`

In this directory you'll find 2 examples of projects where telegraf collects information on a Junos devices and send it to:
 - A timeserie Database - influxdb
 - AWS cloudwatch

## Requirements
To execute this demo you need
 - docker and docker-compose installed on a server or a laptop
 - A Junos device running 16.1R3 minimum

### preparation of the Junos device

In order to be able to collect information on a Junos device, you need to:
- Junos 16.1R3 minimum
- Install the package `JUNOS Network Agent` (available on juniper.net)
- Enable gRPC on your device with the configuration below

```
set system services extension-service request-response grpc clear-text port 50051
set system services extension-service request-response grpc skip-authentication
set system services extension-service notification allow-clients address 0.0.0.0/0
```

# Demo with Influxdb

## Customize the telegraf configuration file

You need to customize telegraf configuration file (`telegraf-influxdb`) to at least indicate the IP address of your Junos device (line 84)

```
[[inputs.openconfig_telemetry]]

  server = "<device IP>:50051"
```
> Optional: You can also change the list of sensors that you want to collect starting line 93

## Start the demo

To start the demo, you need to execute `make start-influxdb`. It will start 2 containers:
1. Influxdb
2. Telegraf

## Verify that everything is running as expected

To check that data are coming into the database, you can access the Admin interface of the database on port `8083`: `http://localhost:8083`

You can also look at telegraf log to verify if telegraf is able to collect some data: `docker logs octelemetrytelegraf_telegraf_1 -f`

here is an example of logs that indicate that everything is working as expected
